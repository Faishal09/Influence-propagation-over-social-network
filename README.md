# Influence-propagation-over-social-network
Today, information diffusion in social network is most popular to spread idea, opinion and share the information. But it is the most widely used in the context of viral marketing. In the viral marketing initially to select a few influencer members (called Target set) in the network and give the information what are you want spread in the network. Our problem is how to identify small number of target set that influence the whole network and reduce computational cast and computation time approximate near linear time. We have use the concept of combinatorial bounds on the size of the minimum perfect target set in terms of the verticesâ€™ degrees and thresholds and developed a new algorithm those have near linear time complexity has generates minimum target set for given the network.
